# Nichijou

Simple SPA website that will hopefully in the future work as a webpage workspace where you can set event, take notes, and even draw on the fly at your whim.
As for now it's just an SPA running with a Rails backend and a JavaScript Frontend.
Super simple functionality that will be adapted in the future!
